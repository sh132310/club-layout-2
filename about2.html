    <h1>About Digital Arts Club</h1>
    <img src="images/da.png" alt="" class="center">
      <p>Digital Arts Club is ran by Mr. Chad Wolf and Mark Sade. This club meets regularly on Tuesdays from 3:37pm to 4:30pm. In this club, you can work on any of your art projects. Sometimes, there is a request from the school.</p>
      <p>Bailey Turner and Tyler Sievertsen created Digital Arts Club because they thought it could help the school with making ads for school events. It also gave students the chance to learn graphic design from others.</p>
      <p>If you are intrested in joining, stop by Mr. Wolf's room (163) or Mr. Sade's room (159) after school on any Tuesday. It runs from 3:37pm to 4:30pm.</p>
